    "\n",
    "This exercise is intended for anyone curious about building A.I. projects.  In order to complete this tutorial, follow along at https://www.leaky.ai. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a neural network from scratch.  You will be introduced to PyTorch, a deep learning library managed by Meta's AI group and the power of neural networks.  We will be working on a synthetic dataset that catalogs the daily number of lemons sold at a lemon stand.  After training, the neural network will be ablet to predict the number of lemons that are likely going to be sold on a given day.  Lets get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1 - If using Google Colab\n",
    "In order to complete this assignment:\n",
    "1.\tCopy the following link: https://github.com/LeakyAI/FirstNeuralNet\n",
    "2.\tHead over to Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/\n",
    "3.\tClick on GitHub and paste in the repo link above\n",
    "4.\tClick the magnify icon on the right side of the link you pasted above\n",
    "5.\tClick on the <b>FirstNeuralNetwork - Start Here.ipynb</b> notebook to get started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2 - If you are running the notebook directly on your own laptop/desktop\n",
    "If you are using your own laptop or desktop and running the notebook locally, we recommend you complete the tutorial on how to configure your PC for A.I. at www.leaky.ai first and then attempt this tutorial.\n",
